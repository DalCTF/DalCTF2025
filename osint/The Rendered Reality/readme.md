# Escape the Simulation

You wake to light spilling through tall panes — or screens, perhaps. It’s hard to tell.  
Beyond them, a shimmer of water and the outline of an island. George’s, you think. Or maybe just a simulation.  
It’s picturesque. Too picturesque.

Around you are whiteboards marked with notes, humming computers, and low orange leather sofas.

A black-and-gold hoodie lies nearby.  
On the console, a terminal blinks:
> [memo.draft]
> “Prashant — please remind the students. Still looking for participants for the UI study.
> Also, fix the George’s Island texture glitch on window 3.”

Faint sounds echo — a lecture? A demonstration?

A message flickers on the wall like mist:

> “To shape new realities, we must first step into them —  
> Tech, design, and innovation — this is where they come together.”

There are seven labs here. One holds the key to your escape. But this is no ordinary lab — it’s built to feel like anything but.

You pause. This place feels familiar. Did you walk these corridors — or just scroll past them in a reel?

They say this is a home base for techies… though not all techies. 😉
