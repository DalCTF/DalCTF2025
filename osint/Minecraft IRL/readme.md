# Minecraft IRL

You take a look around you and see two towering square trees. This is normal because you're in Minecraft. You go to punch one of the trees (as is tradition) but are rewarded with nothing but pain and bloody knuckles. It turns out you're not in Minecraft, you are in real life. Find the location where this photo was taken.

**Flag format:** Coordinates of the building with these trees in front of it rounded to 3 decimal places, separated by _ , wrapped in dalctf{}

**Example:** `dalctf{-0.217_-78.502}`
