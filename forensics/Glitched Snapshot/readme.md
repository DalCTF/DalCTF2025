    “The world is breaking. Textures are missing. Players are vanishing…”
    Deep within the simulation’s core, you intercepted a corrupted data fragment. It appears to contain visual logs from an earlier escape attempt — but nothing opens it.

    Something about the file feels... familiar. If only you could decode the distortion and see what they saw.

    Put the flag you get in:
