## Description

"As you fight your way through the game, you find yourself trudging through terrain that seems a lot like a desert. You look down, and come across a wrinkled .py file covered in sand. It seems to be a shred of the source code from some larger process.

You keep walking, and after a while you come across a looming Sphinx. She says she is guarding the secrets of the Rat Screw Tomb. Can you figure out how to get past her?"
