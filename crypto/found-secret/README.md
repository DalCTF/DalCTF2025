## Description

You've found a weird rectangular shaped device while exploring the game. After playing with it for a while, you found a voice message left from the previous owner: "QUICK! Record this! I've got a secret that might help future players trapped in the back of this game! I've hidden in this device a code that contains the secret, to decipher it you just need to ... AHHHHHH!", the message cuts off with some weird noises in the background. You look through the phone and find this message:

'''Y3prYnNle3EwczRzMW1mXzRtY19xMHM0czFtZn0='''

Can you still decipher it?
