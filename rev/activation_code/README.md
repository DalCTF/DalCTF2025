## Description

"Huh!!! Where am I?? My head and stomach hurts so much, probably because of a bunch of Vietnamese food I ate last night", but then you slowly realized, this is not the real world ... YOU JUST BEING SUCKED INTO A SIMULATION GAME. 

A big blinking text start appearing in front of you saying "Enter the activation code".

You think "Hm, this might be a way for me to get back into the real world, to go back to Saigon, my hometown, to the lovely district of Go Vap, oh I miss it :( But how am I gonna figure out this code??".

Welp, better start soon ;) Time doesn't wait for anyone. People will slowly forget you if you are here too long.
