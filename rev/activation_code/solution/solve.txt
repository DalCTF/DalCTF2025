- The player first should put this into a decompiler.

- validate() then call a bunch of check function, the checkFlag() suppose to be a decoy function. The correct function they should check is checkXOR().

- They will realize checkXOR() then check only even indexes in the key[] array, which contain the encoded hexes of the flag.

- Then the player will take every value in the even indexes, XOR it with 0x55, that would give them the original flag.
