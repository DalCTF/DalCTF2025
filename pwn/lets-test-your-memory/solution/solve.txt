First you need to use a decompilation tool to find out what the flag buffer size is (64)

We also need to understand that even though the flag was read into local memory in the readFlag function, 
fgets actually allocates space on the heap. So even though the flag char array was destroyed, the flag still 
exists somewhere in memory. Since we reallocate heap memory for our guess, we can use that to allocate the 
same chunk that the flag is stored in, and use GDB to inspect/find it.

Here's one sequence of GDB inputs that could lead you to the flag:
	- 2					[Run GDB through the program]
	- n					[Next instruction]
	- n					[Next instruction]
	- n					[Next instruction]
	- 64					[Entering the size of the flag chunk]
	- n					[Next instruction]
	- n 					[Next instruction]
	- p guess 				[Inspect the guess variable once it's been allocated]

You should be able to see that the guess pointer is pointing at the same chunk, which has the flag 
dalCTF{im_57i11_h3r3_guy5}
