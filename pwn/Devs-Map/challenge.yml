description: After exploring the game, you've found a map rummored to show the location of an old weapon used only by the developer of the game. Random NPCs you have talked to have said that this artillery could hold a secret, that might help you reach back to the dev's world. Can you uncover the secrets of the map and maybe get closer to exiting the game?
